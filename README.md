# TurtleCore
This is the core application / library used for all management of userdata and communications by TurtleException.
It is composed of 3 parts:
- The **Core** contains shared classes and functionality. It is not part of the API, but rather a dependency.
- The **Client** is an API library that can be used within other applications.
- The **Server** provides all means of communication and data transfer to the Client and is responsible for central management of all data.

## Using the client API
