# HELP SCREEN - COMMAND 'invalidate-caches'

Invalidates all caches the internal TurtleClient manages and (if instructed via the first parameter) retrieves all
information from the database to re-fill them.
Note that doing so may cause temporary performance issues for the server and to most connected clients as this is an
expensive call that will also fire a lot of remove- / update-events.

Arguments:
    retrieve    (optional)  May be either 'true' or 'false'.
                            Indicates whether the database should be queried after caches have been emptied.

Aliases:
    <none>
